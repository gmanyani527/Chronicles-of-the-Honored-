This project is a linear game developed using C# and Unity, inspired by dynamic and tactical elements reminiscent of the anime character Kakashi Hatake. The game emphasizes key gameplay mechanics, such as NPC interaction, where players receive guidance or challenges, and object collection and usage to solve puzzles or advance through levels.

Combat introduces throwable weapons akin to shuriken or kunai, allowing players to strategically engage aggressive enemies with AI behaviors designed to mimic relentless pursuit and calculated attacks. The inspiration from Kakashi adds a subtle touch of strategy, agility, and tactical depth, encouraging players to think on their feet while navigating the game world. This project served as a creative and technical exploration of Unity game development, blending anime-inspired elements with foundational gameplay systems.
